## Description

For this project we wanted to teach users the fundamentals of building a train network within a city. The application begins by mixing train building with showing a list of pre-written tips for building train networks based on real world cities. Then the user is encouraged to continue expanding their network to as many stations as posible while being limited to three train lines. If passengers wait too long at their station the user's progress will be increasingly slowed until they resolve the issue. 

Thoughout the creation of this project we obtained a deeper understanding of designing an intricate GUI with [Qt](https://www.qt.io). We experimented with different UI layouts and eventually settled on a minimalist design with many visual clues to help the user  understand the purpose of each UI element. Additionally, we added [Box2D](https://box2d.org) (a third-party physics engine) to our project which taught us how to implement third-party packages into Qt. 

## Installation

Download the latest release then unzip the folder and run the file "TrainEduApp.exe" to see our project for yourself.

## Usage

This application can be used to introduce anyone to the simplicity of desigining a train network. Over time the user is steadily given more stations and more train lines to work with. This simulates problems that occur in the real world and encourages the user to produce creative solutions to these problems.
